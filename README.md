Introduction
- Jeepers Creeper XMD is a compact, well-structured toolkit that helps developers work with XML data and Markdown documentation in a cohesive workflow.
- It combines a command line interface (CLI) and a web-friendly experience to let you transform, render, and publish content quickly.
- The project embraces simplicity with clear defaults, but it also supports advanced use cases through flexible configuration and modular components.

Core idea
- The core idea behind Jeepers Creeper XMD is to bridge XML content with Markdown-friendly output.
- It gives you a predictable pipeline: parse XML input, apply transformations, render to Markdown, and optionally export to other formats.
- This approach helps teams standardize their docs, share a single source of truth, and speed up documentation processes.

Overview of what the project offers
- A robust XML parser that handles common XML schemas, namespaces, and structure.
- A Markdown renderer that preserves hierarchy, lists, links, and code blocks with predictable formatting.
- A modular pipeline that can be extended with custom transformations or plugins.
- A minimal CLI that supports batch processing, streaming, and incremental builds.
- A lightweight web UI for quick transforms, previews, and basic batch jobs without leaving the browser.
- Clear logging and error handling so you can pinpoint issues quickly.
- An ecosystem that supports collaboration across teams and across projects.

Why this project exists
